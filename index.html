The company had also shown interest in expanding their web presence to attract more potential business. I took it upon myself to use my personal experience in web design to build a new website from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Upon presentation of my project the management team offered me the role of Web consultant for the company website that was designed by Craig Murray Design in 2010</p>

                <p class="lead"> The website itself is run on WordPress, and since taking control of it I have updated it with all new media content and company biography to bring it up to date with all the businesses news. I have also utilized my skills as a photographer and photo editor to take new staff photos for the management to be used on the website and their individual LinkedIn profiles to generate more connections through the business social media site. I have had bi-monthly meetings with the management staff to go over online strategies to make the site look more updated and maintained for new customers visiting the site. In these meetings I normally present the content I have been working on and receive feedback for any changes I might have to make. I also open up to ideas from the management for anything they want included for particular sectors of the business. </p>

                    <p class="lead">My first Codepen project came from making a weather app for Free Code Camp which uses JSON data from a weather api on <a href="www.darksky.net">Darksky.net</a>. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Using a online IP finder I can find the users latitude and longitude to determine the users location. Using the location it can then send a request to Darksky to retrieve weather information in the form of JSON data. With this data the app will then determine a style and genre of movie to watch based on the user's location weather and time of day.</p>

                    <p class="lead">After creating my movies for weather app on Codepen I decided to use the random array formula I made for the first app for a game me and KJ thought up at a party where we would try to describe the plot of a movie as vaguely as possible and see if the other person could guess the right movie with only the very little information given. </p>
                    <p class="lead">To make the design simple I decided to just use the movies' posters as the background, most of which I linked from Amazon. The plot points I used were a mixture of my own and a few from Reddit forums about vague movie plots.</p>
